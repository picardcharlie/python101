# Demonstrate the use of all logical operators (and, or, not) below.
# Create variables that hold boolean values, then combine them
# to express the following sentence:
#
#   do two wrongs make a right?
# 
# Note that the truth value of the statement doesn't matter,
# but try to use all three logical operators in one line of code
# to get another boolean value as your result :)

wrongs = False
right = True
do = False
two = False
make = True
a = False

print(do and two or wrongs or make and a and not right)
#Is this right?  Instructions didn't seem super clear to me.
