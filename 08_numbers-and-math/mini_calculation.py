# Mini calculation to find the average of me brushing my teeth
# I always remember to brush my teeth before I see my GF and an extra time if I stay over at her place.
# I might forget to brush my teeth daily, maybe.

stay_her_place = 7
average_solo_per_month = 20

average_brush = month / (see_gf_per_month + stay_her_place + average_solo_per_month)
